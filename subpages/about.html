        I am the oldest of four children and we own a dog and 4 ducks which we adopt
        during the summer. I attend Heritage Regional High School and am in the iCan computer program.<br/> With
        high grades in math and science, I prefer programming over 3d modeling or Photoshop. I work at a breakfast
        restaurant in the DIX30 on weekends.
