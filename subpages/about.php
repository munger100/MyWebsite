            I am the oldest of four children. My family is half French, from Saguenay, half English, from Candiac.
            I attend Heritage Regional High School and am in the iCan computer program. With
            high grades in math and science, I prefer programming over 3d modeling or Photoshop. I work in a
            breakfast restaurant at the DIX30 on weekends.
